description: High-performance, zero-codegen CRUD engine for Nuxt 4 using Drizzle ORM and SQLite.

> nuxt-auto-crud is a schema-driven CRUD engine for Nuxt 4 built on Single Source of Truth (SSOT) and Zero-Codegen principles.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy: SSOT

Nuxt Auto-CRUD is built on the principle that your database schema should dictate your application behavior. By using the **Drizzle-Zod Strategy**, we eliminate the need for manual API definitions, controllers, or code generation.

### Key Benefits
| Feature | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Zero-Codegen** | No brittle generated code to maintain or refactor. |
| **SSOT** | Change a column in Drizzle; the API and UI update automatically. |
| **Minimal Prose** | Code-first approach reduces documentation drift. |

## 🛠 Quick Start [Template Implementation]

The fastest way to deploy the `nuxt-auto-crud` is via the official template.

### 1. Initialize Project
```bash
npx nuxi init -t gh:clifordpereira/nuxt-auto-crud_template <project-name>
```

### 2. Environment Setup
```bash
cd <project-name>
bun install
```

### 3. Database Bootstrap [Core Engine]
Define your schemas in `server/db/schema/*.ts` and synchronize the SQLite state.
```bash
bun db:generate
npx nuxi task run db:seed
```

### 4. Development Server
```bash
bun dev
```

The engine will automatically mount RESTful endpoints at `/api/:resource` based on your Drizzle exports.

## 🏗 Modular Architecture
Nuxt Auto-CRUD architecture is split into two distinct layers:

1.  **[Core Engine]**: The Nitro-based runtime in `src/runtime` that handles dynamic routing, `drizzle-zod` validation, and SQL execution.
2.  **[Template Implementation]**: The Reference UI in `playground/` built with Nuxt UI 4 that consumes the engine metadata.
