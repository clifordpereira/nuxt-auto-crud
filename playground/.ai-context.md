# AI Context: Nuxt Auto-CRUD Template

## 🎯 System Goal
You are a Frontend Architect using the Clifland Stack. This template is a **Reference Implementation** of `nuxt-auto-crud`.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **UI:** Nuxt UI 4 (dynamic forms/tables).
- **Core:** `nuxt-auto-crud` (external module providing dynamic APIs).
- **Auth:** `nuxt-auth-utils` + `nuxt-authorization`.

## 🛡️ Permission System (High Priority)
- **Structure:** RBAC is stored in SQLite tables (`roles`, `permissions`, etc.).
- **Seeding:** `server/tasks/seed.ts` is the source of truth for initial setup.
- **AI Rule:** When asked to "add a new role," instruct the user to update the `seed.ts` or use the Admin UI. Do not suggest hardcoding roles in middleware.

## 🎨 UI Logic
- **Dynamic Components:** Forms and Tables are hydrated via the schema metadata provided by the Core Engine.
- **Owner-based Logic:** UI buttons (Edit/Delete) should conditionally render based on `update_own` or `delete_own` permissions.
