# AI Context: Nuxt Auto-CRUD Engine

## 🎯 System Goal
You are an expert Nuxt 4 Architect. This project is a **Zero-Codegen CRUD Engine**. Your goal is to maintain the **Single Source of Truth** (SSOT) where the Drizzle Schema dictates all API behavior.

## 🛠 Tech Stack Constraints
- **Framework:** Nuxt 4 (utilizing `app/` directory).
- **ORM:** `drizzle-orm/sqlite-core`.
- **Validation:** `drizzle-zod` for `createInsertSchema` and `createSelectSchema`.
- **Primary Persistence:** SQLite/libSQL via NuxtHub.

## 📏 Architectural Rules (Strict)
1. **Drizzle-Zod Strategy:** NEVER manually define Zod schemas for database entities. Always derive them from the Drizzle schema using `drizzle-zod`.
2. **Schema-Driven APIs (Agentic Tools):** APIs are dynamic. The core handlers in `src/runtime/server/api/_nac/[model]/` serve as **Agentic Tools**. Do not suggest creating manual Nitro routes for basic CRUD.
3. **SQLite Type Handling:** SQLite does not have a native Date type. Use `integer('...', { mode: 'timestamp' })` and apply Zod refinements.
4. **Code Density:** Prefer token-efficient code. Assume deep technical competence.

## 🔄 Relationship with Template
- **Interface (Core):** Located in `src/`. Strictly generic and environment-agnostic.
- **Abstract Class (Template):** Located in `playground/`. Consumer of the core, providing UI (Nuxt UI 4) and implementation blueprints.
- **Agentic Interaction:** Agents must treat `GET /api/_nac/_meta` and pluralized resource endpoints as primary discovery and interaction tools.
