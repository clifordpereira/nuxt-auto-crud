# Playground Backend Only

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository/directory is currently **not our priority**.

We are currently concentrating fully on the [Playground (Full-stack Template)](../playground), which serves as the primary implementation and blueprint for `nuxt-auto-crud`.

Development on this standalone backend version may restart if there is significant demand from users of other frameworks (e.g., React.js) wanting to connect to the `nuxt-auto-crud` engine.
